List what to be finished:
1) Implement D* lite (From Sven Koenig paper)

2) Fix the bug on the pedestrians:
	a) It sometimes move outside of the pavement.
		This maybe due to the fact that we just count
		the number of needed steps. And this is just
		approximated (Rounded to the above integers).
	b) Some pedestrians sometimes go outside the
		environment (Y > Y_MAX) ... Don't know why.

3) Change the implementation on how the environment
	pass the pedestrian to the planner:
	a) The environment should only pass the pedestrian
		who are visible to the car (100m ahead?)

4) Create a test system: ----ALMOST DONE-----
	a) Must be able to detect collision
	b) Must be able to measure the time needed
	   for the car to move from Y_MIN to Y_MAX
	c) If possible, allow batch measuring

5) Create better GUI:
	a) Apply some picture for the car
	b) create 2 lines and the car can continue to the 
	   second line after the first line and move back
		to the first line afterward (the other line 
		always give the road ahead)

6) Create smarter pedestrian:
	a) have some reaction to the car
	b) but must make sure the car still need
	   to avoid something. Otherwise, the car
		will only go straight with no pedestrian
		crossings.

7) Create a controllable random system:
	a) we can specify a seed, and the same seed mean
		exactly the same event will occur.
	b) I have tried creating this, but somehow failed.
		The initialization already done. But the event
		after always changing. (Due to thread??).
